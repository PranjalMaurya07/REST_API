ChatGPT
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs. REST APIs are designed to be stateless and cacheable, allowing for a scalable and flexible way to connect and communicate between different software systems. They typically return data in formats like JSON or XML, making it easy to integrate and use across various platforms and languages.
